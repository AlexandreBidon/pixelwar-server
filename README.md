# Pixel War server
 Server side of the [Pixel War app](https://github.com/AlexandreBidon/pixelwar).

## Launch the server
First, install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You can then launch the `__main__.py` to start the server.

## Issues
- Desync issues : some client can disconnect without any info from the server. They are then unable to use the app

## TODO
- Improve logging 
- Add a unique client id
- Add HTTPS support
- Resolve desync issues
